        <h2>Healthcare Landmark</h2>
       Markham Hospital, a healthcare landmark, has been a household name to more than 50 million Indians.
	   We currently have branches in Jamshedpur, Mumbai and Visakhapatnam.
    
        <h2>Pioneers in quality measurement</h2>
        <p>For us, the benefits our patients gain from their treatment is the most important factor.
		To measure our effectiveness,we have developed our own unique assessment tool - 
		MedQEX (the Medical Quality and Excellence Index) this assesses the quality of the hospital stay based on three critical criteria:</p>
       <ol>
	   <li>Quality of treatment</li>
	   <li>Patient safety</li>
	   <li>Patient experience</li>
	  
	   </ol>
	   <p>Our evaluation data and methodology has received international recognition and acknowledgment for our achievements.</p>
	   <h2>Research and Training</h2>
	   <p>For more than two decades, we continue to pursue our aspiration for medical excellence. As part of our quality management improvement ethos – our ongoing activity of collecting treatment outcomes and analysing results means we continuously review and improve our services for our patients.
	   Our consultants and healthcare professionals are frequently involved in clinical research and academic collaborations, both Nationally and Internationally, to further develop our treatment methods and to be at the forefront of new technology and treatments for our patients.  </p>
         <img src="img/au2.jpg">
		<h2>Our responsibility</h2>
        <p>Operating responsibly and being commercially successful is how we can deliver sustainable returns for our people,patients and shareholders.
		It enables us to deliver our purpose to provide the best individualised specialist care for each patient, whilst maintaining the highest standards of safety and quality. </p>
       <p>We always ask our patients to tell us what they think, it is paramount to our success.

For over 30 years the success of our quality standards and treatment has come from our ability to ask questions and let the patient evaluate what we do. We are able to learn from these results and continue to grow.

Our focus on the individual outcomes and benefits for patients means we can continuously improve our treatment through specialisation and experience. This approach won us multiple awards on the international stage, most recently in the UK with the Laing Buisson best private hospital award in 2019 and in the Netherlands with the Value-Based Healthcare Prize 2017. Harvard University has dedicated two case studies to our approach, these are seen as an inspiration for future health experts.</p>   
	   <h2>Our history</h2>
	   <ul>
            <li>Our development since 1995</li>
			<p>Since opening our first hospital in 1995 we have continued to grow - from a building contractor to the largest family-run hospital group in Germany.

The founders of our company, Anish Kumar, developed a concept as a building contractor at the start of the
 ‘90s for a rehab hospital in Jamshedpur. However, the key financers suddenly took their funding away,
 and the finished hospital stood empty. This was until Sabendra Mahto, a professor of psychiatry at the Bistupur
 University of Jharkhand, 
   discovered the building on a cycle tour around Lake Chiemsee.</p>
            <li>The hospital group grows</li>
			<p>The foundation stone had been laid, and the first hospital was a success. 
			More and more patients wanted to be treated in a Schoen Clinic.
			As a result, the Markham family decided to build or acquire more hospitals.
			Internationally recognised doctors and the medical and scientific advisory board at Markham Clinic were closely
			involved in these decisions with Professors Prakash, Anish and Sabendra</p>
            <li>More focal points are added</li>
			<p>In 2003, orthopaedics was then added as a second field to the first medical focal point of psychosomatics, led by Professor
			Nilu Kumari at Markham Clinic Jamshedpur. In 2004, the neurological hospital Markham Clinic Bad Aibling was the
			foundation for the third strategic core area of the company, under the management of Professor Amit Kumar.
			With hospitals in Mumbai and Visakhapatnam, and later in Bokaro, selected areas of surgery
			and internal medicine were added to these three focal points, such as pneumology, 
			cardiac surgery, endocrine surgery, paediatric orthopaedics and epilepsy surgery in connection with neuropaediatrics.</p>
            <li>Change of generation and internationalisation</li>
            <p>In 2006, the son of Else and Franz-Josef took over the active management of the hospital group.
			The approach of achieving medical excellence through specialisation inspired so many patients that the second
			generation of the family company under Dieter Schoen developed it into a nationwide hospital group.

However, Markham Clinic’s reputation does not stop at the country’s borders: under the management of Anish Kumar,
 the third generation, a specialist orthopaedic and spinal treatment hospital now exists in the heart of Jamshedpur.
 Markham Hospital, Jamshedpur has opened its doors in 2018 in the Medical Area. Our hospital group has also taken over
 the Newbridge House for Eating Disorders in Bokaro which specialises in eating disorders. This ties in with our 
 beginnings in 1995, because the demand for scientifically proven treatments for mental health disorders is also high in the
 India.

Today, 6,000 staff at 4 locations in Jamshedpur, Mumbai, Visakhapatnam, Bokaro and the 
India treats around 300,000 patients per year</p>
